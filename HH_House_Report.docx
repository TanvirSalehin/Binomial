                           Hunain House


The bright sunshine approaches towards the Earth more when the night darkens more. The igneous red rays of the sun fall upon the black darkness of whetstone night to let the darkness fade away making space for daylight to come in. In the same manner, the 100 cadets of Hunain House passing over thousands of incomprehensive paths to reach the door of success. We, the Hunainians believe that through the combination of four pillars namely brotherhood, unity, combined efforts and the blessings of Allah, the Almighty we were able to make our house the overall champion in the year 2021. To glorify the crown, we snatched away the Overall Games in 2021. Not only this, the cadets of Hunain House who carry their house colour in their veins, never fail to form the best of the best athletes from the house.
The outstanding contribution of the athletes made it possible to achieve this title in the field. Worth mentioning except the year 2018, Hunainians are unbeaten crown holders of athletics for long 12 years by the grace of Allah, the Almighty. This house didn’t fall apart to prove their excellence in co-curricular activities. The field of co-curricular activities is emblazoned by each and every cadet of this house. We believe that we are one unit combining 100 cadets. Whenever we participate, we participate being one unit. This is the magic mentality behind our success. Apart from curricular and co-curricular activities, Hunainians are determined to achieve a better academic result for their better future. This thought accelerated them for snatching away the Overall Academics in 2021. In addition, among the six best cadets (an initiative taken by our honourable principal K.M. Obayedul Haque), 04 were from Hunain House. Hunainians didn’t forget to represent JCC towards the entire world. In various olympiads held nationally, Cadet Shishir (2988/XI) along with other members have gained praise all over the country.
In international fields, Cadet Samin (2861/XII) and Cadet Muhaimin (2897/XI) have got the “Outstanding Delegate” award and the “Honourable Mention” award that made JCC “The best Delegation” in BUPIUM-2021.
We own a different identity, we are “The Valiant Hunainians” firmly determined to keep the red flag at any cost. If Almighty Allah wants, we will continue our legacy like this.
I believe, Hunainians will never let their throne and crown as well as the sword of faith down. Inshaa Allah, they will become the best examples of worthy, successful and good humans.
